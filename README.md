MY APPROACH:

As there is no database i used in-memory ConcurrentHashMap is used to store receipts.
A universally unique identifier (UUID) ensures each receipt is assigned a distinct ID.
Each request is processed independently, and no persistent storage is required, making the service lightweight.

At controller layer I handled API requests and processed the receipts and retrned unique ID for every receipt
and all the logic of points calculation and mapping receipts and ID are written in Service layer
